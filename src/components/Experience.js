                This role includes creating and building React sites from
                scratch. Deploying sites using AWS and Github. Working with
                Github repositaires. I also work with Jenkins to deploy branches
                to Development for testing. Write Jest and Cypress tests for
                React code. I mainly use SASS and Javascript within the project.
                I have worked on multiple sites accross the company. Jumping
                between Gulp, Grunt, SASS, LESS, Java projects and React. Often
                being the only Front end web developer in the department, I'm
                being shared between projects so multi-tasking and hitting
                deadlines is a must as its usually Agile working to two week
                sprints. I have learnt to work under extreme stress and pressure
                and this has enabled me to learn fast and keep current!
